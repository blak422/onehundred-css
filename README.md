A simple 16 column css grid

## Introduction

Inpired by the simplicity of the [1% CSS Grid](http://onepcssgrid.mattimling.com/) I
took the approach and tried to make it work full screen. So far so good.

## What is 100% CSS

100% CSS Grid is a 16 column fluid system. It aims to serve as a base for building
responsive websites with ease. It will take care of most of the resizing for
you without having to build for different platforms.

100% CSS Grid aims to adapt to all screen resolutions without having a base resolution.

The base column class (.col1) is 4.8438% wide with a right margin of 1.5%.

## Testing

So far it has only been tested in Chromium and Fireforx on a Ubuntu PC.

## Todo

- [ ] Test in Windows (IE, Chrome, Safari, etc)
- [ ] Test image resizing
- [x] Add media queries for small screens
